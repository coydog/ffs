FFS
Fill FileSystem
by coydog

FFS is a freespace wiper. It is intended to improve compression of
filesystem images by removing unlinked data and metadata from previously
deleted files. It's not intended as a privacy tool, since things like
filesystem fragmentation may prevent it from wiping everything, but it works
in much the same way as many other disk wipers.

FFS will write files filled containing binary zero's in the current working 
directory until the filesystem is full. The user is responsible for
deleting the files when it is finished. FFS won't clobber existing files.

Compile using 

  cc -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 -o ffs src/ffs.c
  
or 

  cc -o ffs ffs.c 
  
First ensure you don't have any important files named "binzero*", then run

  ./ffs && rm binzero*
